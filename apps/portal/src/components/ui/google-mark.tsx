/**
 * Google's four-colour mark, for "Continue with Google".
 *
 * Inline rather than a remote asset because Google's brand guidelines require
 * the mark to be shown unaltered, and an <img> to ssl.gstatic would be a
 * third-party request on the sign-in form — one that fails silently behind a
 * content blocker and leaves the button looking unfinished.
 *
 * The same artwork is inlined in the signup flow (apps/web account-step.tsx).
 * It lives in both because the two apps share no component package; if one is
 * ever created, this is one of the first things that should move into it.
 *
 * ── SIZING ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No default size is set here, because the two Buttons disagree about who wins.
 * ui/button pins every icon with `[&_svg]:size-4`, so a size passed here is
 * overridden and the v1 login simply takes 16px. ui-v2/button writes the same
 * rule as `[&_svg:not([class*='size-'])]:size-4`, which steps aside for an icon
 * carrying its own `size-` — so the v2 login, whose row is h-12 with text-base,
 * passes `size-5` and gets it.
 *
 * `aria-hidden` because the button's own text already says "Continue with
 * Google"; announcing the logo as well would just repeat the word.
