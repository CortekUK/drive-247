AI-Powered Insurance Document Verification
Strategy Document & US Compliance Data
1. The Problem Statement
When implementing AI-assisted insurance verification, a critical gap exists: what criteria does the AI use to validate documents? Without proper validation logic, several issues arise:
    • Users could upload irrelevant documents (receipts, random PDFs, images)
    • Valid insurance documents might be incorrectly rejected
    • Fraudulent or tampered documents could pass verification
    • Coverage requirements may not meet state-specific minimums
2. Multi-Layer Verification Strategy
The AI verification system should implement four distinct validation layers, each performing specific checks before allowing a document to proceed.
Layer 1: Document Type Recognition
Determines whether the uploaded file is actually an insurance document.
    1. Standard Insurance Markers: Look for phrases like "Certificate of Insurance," "Declarations Page," "Insurance Policy," "Evidence of Coverage"
    2. Company Identification: Detect insurance company letterhead, logo, or NAIC (National Association of Insurance Commissioners) number
    3. Form Identifiers: Recognize ACORD forms (industry-standard), state-specific forms, or carrier-specific declaration formats
    4. File Format Validation: Accept PDF, JPG, PNG; reject executables, zip files, or corrupted files
Layer 2: Required Field Extraction & Validation
Extract and validate all mandatory fields using OCR and pattern matching.
Field
Validation Rule
Example Pattern
Policy Number
Alphanumeric, 8-20 characters
PAP-2024-789456123
Policyholder Name
Must match renter's name (fuzzy match)
John A. Smith / John Smith
Effective Date
Valid date, must be ≤ today
01/15/2024 or 2024-01-15
Expiration Date

01/15/2025 or 2025-01-15
Insurance Company
Match against known carriers list
State Farm, GEICO, Progressive
Coverage Limits
Must meet state minimums
$25,000/$50,000/$25,000

Layer 3: Business Rule Validation
Apply business logic to ensure the policy meets rental requirements.
    • Policy Status: Verify policy is active (not expired, cancelled, or suspended)
    • Coverage Adequacy: Liability limits meet or exceed state minimums and rental company requirements
    • Recognized Provider: Insurance company is licensed in the rental state
    • Rental Coverage: Policy extends to rental vehicles (check for rental exclusions)
Layer 4: Fraud Detection
Detect potential document manipulation or fraud.
    • Tampering Detection: Check for image editing artifacts, inconsistent fonts, or pixel anomalies
    • Data Consistency: Cross-validate all fields (dates align, policy number format matches carrier)
    • API Verification (Optional): Query insurance company databases via ACORD XML or carrier APIs
3. US State Minimum Liability Requirements
Each US state mandates minimum auto insurance coverage. The format shown is Bodily Injury per Person / Bodily Injury per Accident / Property Damage (in thousands of dollars).
